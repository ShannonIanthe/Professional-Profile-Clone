# Professional-Profile-Clone
Creating a clone of an online professional profile 

For my first day of bootcamp my assignment was to replicate a professional profile.<br>
This was a guided class and exceptionally useful in helping me use html and css more efficiently. <br>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>
How to correctly use div elements<br>
How to style using grid and flexbox <br>
How to organize and set up my html page <br>
